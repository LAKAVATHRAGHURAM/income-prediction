## Predicting Income Levels using RandomForestClassifier

# Introduction
- This project aims to predict income levels based on various features using a RandomForestClassifier model.

# Dependencies
- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

# Dataset
- The dataset used for this project is sourced from 'train.csv'.
- It contains information about individuals, including features like education, workclass, occupation, marital status, relationship, race, native country, and income level.
- The target variable is 'income level' categorized as '>50K' or '<=50K'.

# Data Preprocessing
- Data preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and dropping unnecessary columns.

# Feature Selection
- Feature selection was performed using correlation analysis and feature importance scores from RandomForestClassifier.

# Model Training
- RandomForestClassifier was used to train the predictive model.
- Hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

# Evaluation
- Model performance was evaluated using accuracy score on the test dataset.
- Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were considered.

# Results
- The RandomForestClassifier achieved an accuracy score of [insert score here] on the test dataset.
- Features like [mention important features] significantly influenced the prediction of income levels.

# Future Improvements
- Explore additional data sources to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Experiment with alternative modeling techniques for comparison.

# Conclusion
- In conclusion, the RandomForestClassifier demonstrates promising results in predicting income levels based on the provided features.
